XCOM Leader mod for XCOM2
By Long War Studios

This mod adds an upgrade path for XCOM soldiers, that of being a 'leader.' Leaders draw from a pool of 10 new abilities, of which a single leader can eventually learn up to 5.

- Leaders are unlocked via an upgrade to the Guerilla Tactics School. This upgrade is purchasable when the player has gotten at least one soldier to the rank of Sergeant.
- The Guerilla Tactics School upgrade unlocks a Training Slot for training soldiers with leader abilities.
- Soldiers must be of a corresponding baseline rank to be able to train a leader perk, starting with Sergeants being able to train the first leader level.
- Except in dire emergencies, only one leader can be taken on a mission at a time.
- Many leader abilities use the concept of 'Command Range' - this range increases as the leader gains leader rank by training additional leader abilities. This can be viewed by toggling a button in the mission UI.
